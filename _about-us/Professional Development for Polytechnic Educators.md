![](/images/52559612_ml.jpg)

To ensure that polytechnic educators are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to undertake the roles of class leadership, module leadership and module cluster leadership roles, each polytechnic has put in place structured programmes for their educators.

In addition, for course and school leaders as well as for T&amp;L Mentors, sectorial programmes were developed by JP-CETL to enable the polytechnics to leverage on sector-based opportunities to enrich professional development in T&amp;L leadership through deliberate opportunities to network, exchange experiences and collaborate. 

The Professional Development programmes for course leaders is called <strong>Course Leadership Move-In Programme (CLMP)</strong>, for school leaders is <strong> School Leadership Move-In Programme (SLMP)</strong> and for T&amp;L Mentors is <strong>T&amp;L Mentor Move-In Programme (TLMP)</strong>. A sectorial professional development programme for capability development of new lectures was also developed by JP-CETL, which is called <strong>Certificate in Teaching and Learning for Polytechnic Educators (CTLPE)</strong>. &nbsp;A tailored program aimed at certifying new adjunct lecturers in effective teaching practices is called **Certificate in Teaching &amp; Learning for Adjunct Lecturers (CTLAL)**.
