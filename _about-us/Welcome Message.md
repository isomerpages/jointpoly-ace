JP-AcE was birthed in 2022 by the desire for greater connection among the different polytechnics in Singapore in area of teaching and learning (T&L). 

The Academy is dedicated to developing and raising the T&L capability and competencies of polytechnic educators, to augment the quality of education in polytechnic sector. We do this by leveraging on strengths and innovations of the various polytechnics and facilitating collaborations to all involved in T&L in the polytechnics.

The suite of joint-polytechnic T&L baseline capability development programmes and certifications offered by Jp-AcE are integral to this work. These include the <strong>Certificate in T&L for Polytechnic Educators (CTLPE), School Leadership Move-In Programme (SLMP), T&L Mentor Move-In Programme (TLMP) and Course Leadership Move-In Programme (CLMP</strong>). These are programme developed by polytechnic staff, for polytechnic staff. 

We are committed to educational development, and our work is underpinned by these values:
