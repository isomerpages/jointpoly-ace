Welcome to the website of the Joint-Polytechnic Academy for Educators (JP-AcE).

Whether you’re already a member of the polytechnic sector, or reading this site to find out more, we’re glad to share with you the role of our Academy in polytechnic sector in Singapore.  

JP-AcE was launched on 18 November 2022 by the desire for greater connection among five polytechnics in Singapore in the area of teaching and learning (T&L). 

This is the first time that the five polytechnics have come together to create an Academy dedicated to developing and raising the T&L capability and competencies of polytechnic educators, to augment the quality of education in polytechnic sector. We do this by leveraging on strengths and innovations of the five polytechnics and facilitating collaborations to all involved in T&L in the polytechnics and other organisations.

As of now, JP-AcE is offering two categories of programmes. The first category is for new polytechnic lecturers to develop their foundational skills in teaching & learning. This 1-year certification program is called <strong>_Certificate in T&L for Polytechnic Educators_</strong>. The T&L leadership programmes forms the second category, which includes 200-hour programme for School Leaders (<strong>_School Leadership Move-in Programme_</strong>), 160-hour programme for T&L Mentor (<strong>_T&L Mentors Move-in Programme_</strong>) and 100-hour programme for course leaders (<strong>_Course Leadership Move-In Programme_</strong>). We are also looking into the development of programmes in the areas of digitalisation, flip classroom learning, etc.

We are collaborating with Institute of Adult Learning (IAL) – Singapore University of Social Sciences and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) to develop programmes in Adult Learning. 

We believe that an educator is the most important pillar in students learning, which in turn shapes the workforce of the nation. Therefore, the educator must be competent for a better workforce.  We are committed to the professional development of T&L for polytechnic educators, and our work is underpinned by these values:

*   Future-oriented
*   Agile
*   Collaboration
*   Excellence

The Academy, together with the polytechnic community and partners, looks ahead to a generation of future-ready educators for the growth of Singapore.  Do find out more about what we do in this website, and we hope to work with you some time.
