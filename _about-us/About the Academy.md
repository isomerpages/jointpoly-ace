# About the Academy

The Joint Polytechnic Academy for Educators (JP-AcE) was set up in 2022 as a centralised academy dedicated to developing and raising the Teaching & Learning (T&L) capability of polytechnic educators.

It offers a suite of joint-polytechnic T&L baseline capability development programmes and certifications, such as <strong>Certificate in T&L for Polytechnic Educators (CTLPE)</strong>, <strong>School Leadership Move-In Programme (SLMP)</strong>, <strong>T&L Mentor Move-In Programme (TLMP)</strong> and <strong>Course Leadership Move-In Programme (CLMP)</strong>, amongst other programmes and initiatives, to strengthen the T&L capabilities of polytechnic educators.

JP-AcE takes guidance from the <strong>Joint Polytechnic Committee to Enhance Teaching & Learning (JP-CETL) Steering Committee </strong> and works closely with the polytechnics and other stakeholders.

Information on JP-CETL and on the polytechnic sector in Singapore is provided below.
