* <strong>School Leadership</strong> – to oversee T&L directions of school, ensure the quality of courses and outcomes, the quality of teaching and assessment, and the provision of T&L staff development

These five roles are not mutually exclusive. There is an expectation that staff holding T&L roles at levels above class leadership should be able to demonstrate the role expectations at the levels below.

The T&L Mentor Pathway establishes a network of advocates of the T&L Ethos who will work in collaboration with the Education Development Unit (or equivalent) to support course, school, and institutional leadership in lifting T&L capabilities development and quality. It is a commitment of resources dedicated to enhancing academic staff T&L capabilities, growing the quality in T&L, and furthering the T&L ethos of Polytechnic Lecturers.

Mentors will work in a variety of formal and informal ways with individual academic staff, modules, courses and schools to

* enhance T&L practice;
* enable the professional growth of academic staff;
* drive and implement T&L innovation and quality enhancements; and
* promote a professional culture of evidence-based practice and the exchange of ideas and insights across the community.
