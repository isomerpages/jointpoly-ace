#### Key T&L Roles of Polytechnic Educators

![](/images/66739244_ML.jpg)

The key T&L roles for leadership as well as mentor for polytechnic educators in Singapore are shown in the following figure.


The five key T&L roles include:

* <strong>Class Leadership</strong> – to lead learners and influencing learning within the classes assigned
* <strong>Module Leadership</strong> – to lead module design in relation to the course, influencing the module learning experience, ensuring the module’s quality of teaching and assessment
* <strong>Module Cluster Leadership</strong> – to oversee the design and alignment of the cluster of modules in relation to the course, influencing the learning experience across the module cluster, impacting quality of teaching and assessment for the cluster
* <strong>Course Leadership</strong> – to lead course design in alignment with industry trends, and national & polytechnic directions, to ensure the quality of the course experience and outcomes, and the quality of teaching and assessment in the course
* <strong>School Leadership</strong> – to oversee T&L directions of school, ensure the quality of courses and outcomes, the quality of teaching and assessment, and the provision of T&L staff development

These five roles are not mutually exclusive. There is an expectation that staff holding T&L roles at levels above class leadership should be able to demonstrate the role expectations at the levels below.

The T&L Mentor Pathway establishes a network of advocates of the T&L Ethos who will work in collaboration with the Education Development Unit (or equivalent) to support course, school, and institutional leadership in lifting T&L capabilities development and quality. It is a commitment of resources dedicated to enhancing academic staff T&L capabilities, growing the quality in T&L, and furthering the T&L ethos of Polytechnic Lecturers.

Mentors will work in a variety of formal and informal ways with individual academic staff, modules, courses and schools to

* enhance T&L practice;
* enable the professional growth of academic staff;
* drive and implement T&L innovation and quality enhancements; and
* promote a professional culture of evidence-based practice and the exchange of ideas and insights across the community.
