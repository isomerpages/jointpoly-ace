# Programmatic or Project-based Partnership

![](/images/54123485_ml.jpg)

Polytechnics and SUSS-IAL are offering possible areas of joint collaboration for programmatic or project-based partnership.

There are opportunities for co-curation, co-development and co-delivery of programmes, and levelling up of specific competencies for Polytechnics’ AEs, in areas including but not limited to the existing and the new programmes offered by JP-AcE.

Professional development can be through co-curation, co-development and co-delivery of a full module(s) or part of a full WSQ programme or Programme(s) designed and aligned to the SSG’s Skills Framework for the TAE Sector and/or corporate trainers in enterprises with contextualised needs.

Participating adult educators can also co-curate Continuing Professional Development programmes (e.g. bite size, micro-learning credentialling, e-learning modules) to uplift AEs’ skillsets in both Polytechnics and SUSS-IAL.
