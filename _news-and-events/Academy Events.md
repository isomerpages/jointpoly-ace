#### 1. Certificate in Teaching and Learning for Polytechnic Educators (CTLPE) Graduation Ceremony 2023

Date: 7 Jun 2023

Time: 2pm-4pm

Venue:  Republic Polytechnic (RP)

On a rainy afternoon of 7th June 2023 in Republic Polytechnic, over a hundred polytechnic educators celebrated their successful completion of the 100-hour Certificate in Teaching &amp; Learning for Polytechnic Educators (CTLPE) at a graduation ceremony with their mentors, colleagues, and other well-wishers. CTLPE Intakes 6 and 7 are the first CTLPE graduands to have a live graduation ceremony where they were able to celebrate in person.

The ceremony included a series of impactful addresses, commencing with an inspiring opening speech delivered by Ms. Loh Chuu Yi, Deputy Principal of Nanyang Polytechnic and Co-chair of JP-CETL. Following this, heartfelt speeches were given by the CTLPE graduands, Mr. Ameer-Alrasyeed Ramdan from Temasek Polytechnic (CTLPE Intake 6) and Mr. Aloysius Wee from Republic Polytechnic (CTLPE Intake 7), offering insights derived from their respective educational journeys. Concluding the speeches, Dr. Rajnish Gupta, Head of JP-AcE delivered a motivational thank-you address, further encouraging the attendees of the ceremony.

The highlight of the Ceremony was a panel discussion featuring recipients of multiple teaching accolades, namely Associate Professor Mark Chong from Singapore Management University and Ms. Iman Tang from Temasek Polytechnic, who shared their profound insights and expertise on the topic of "Enhancing Student Engagement in the Post-COVID Era”. This engrossing dialogue served as a focal point, captivating the attention of the audience. The ceremony ended with an opportunity for attendees to engage in networking activities while partaking in refreshments, thereby fostering further connections and dialogue.



#### 2. Joint Polytechnic School Leadership Move-In Programme (SLMP) Onboarding 2023

Date: 23-25 and 30-31 May 2023

Venues: Singapore Polytechnic (SP) and Learning Journeys to various locations

School leaders from the five polytechnics delved into concepts of educational change, teaching and learning (T&amp;L) quality and T&amp;L culture at the Onboarding Programme for the joint-polytechnic School Leadership Move-in Programme (SLMP) in May 2023. At the five-day programme, 15 SLMP participants came together to discuss, reflect and to learn from senior polytechnic leaders as well as from each other. They were in turn inspired, challenged, intrigued, and encouraged by what they experienced; the Learning Journeys to Pathlight School and AI Singapore provided much food for thought. An important takeaway for all was that people are at the heart of leadership.

SLMP 2023 will continue with a series of learning journeys to the various polytechnics. Participants will also work on their SLMP practicum projects; these will focus on T&amp;L leadership, but may relate to themes such as digitization, industry engagement, pedagogical innovation and/or staff capability enhancement.
