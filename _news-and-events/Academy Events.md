Date: 7 Jun 2023

Time: 2pm-4pm

Venue:  Republic Polytechnic (RP)

On a rainy afternoon of 7th June 2023 at Republic Polytechnic, over a hundred polytechnic lecturers celebrated their successful completion of the Certificate in Teaching &amp; Learning for Polytechnic Educators (CTLPE) at a graduation ceremony with their mentors, colleagues, and other well-wishers.&nbsp;

The Graduation Ceremony was conducted in a face-to-face manner, marking a significant milestone as it represented the inaugural instance of such an occasion since the CTLPE inception in 2019. The primary objective of this ceremony was to provide a symbolic culmination of the academic journey for the graduating cohort of CTLPE students by providing them a memorable experience. In addition, the event aimed to develop a strong sense of camaraderie and interconnectedness among the graduates from five polytechnics, thereby fostering a lasting sense of community within the CTLPE program.
