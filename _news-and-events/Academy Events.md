On 18 November 2022, the polytechnic community came together to witness the launch of the Joint Polytechnic Academy for Educators (JP-AcE).

At the event, the work and the plans for the Academy were shared, and the members of the new unit were introduced. DP Mah recounted how JP-AcE began as an idea that has now come to fruition, and emphasised the importance of collaboration between all the polytechnics. The JP-AcE logo, signifying the coming together of all the polytechnics to form a solid foundation for teaching and learning, was unveiled. Event attendees had the opportunity to connect with others who were involved in joint-polytechnic teaching & learning projects and programmes.
