<h4>1. Certificate in Teaching and Learning for Polytechnic Educators (CTLPE) Graduation Ceremony 2023</h4>
<p>Date: 7 Jun 2023</p>
<p>Time: 2pm-4pm</p>
<p>Venue: Republic Polytechnic (RP)</p>
<p>On a rainy afternoon of 7th June 2023 at Republic Polytechnic, over a
hundred polytechnic lecturers celebrated their successful completion of
the Certificate in Teaching &amp; Learning for Polytechnic Educators (CTLPE)
at a graduation ceremony with their mentors, colleagues, and other well-wishers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Graduation Ceremony was conducted in a face-to-face manner, marking
a significant milestone as it represented the inaugural instance of such
an occasion since the CTLPE inception in 2019. The primary objective of
this ceremony was to provide a symbolic culmination of the academic journey
for the graduating cohort of CTLPE students by providing them a memorable
experience. In addition, the event aimed to develop a strong sense of camaraderie
and interconnectedness among the graduates from five polytechnics, thereby
fostering a lasting sense of community within the CTLPE program.</p>

<p>In her opening address, Ms. Loh Chuu Yi, Deputy Principal from Nanyang
Polytechnic, and Co-chair of the Joint-Polytechnic Committee to Enhance
Teaching &amp; Learning (JP-CETL) warmly congratulated the graduands on
the completion of CTLPE and the start of their new careers as polytechnic
educators. She also encouraged them to continue reflecting and putting
into practice what they had learnt into their teaching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graduands Mr. Ameer-Alrasyeed Ramdan from Temasek Polytechnic (CTLPE Intake
6) and Mr. Aloysius Wee from Republic Polytechnic (CTLPE Intake 7) both
reflected on their teaching journey in passionate sharings. Mr. Ramdan
felt that their roles as lecturers goes far beyond disseminating information;
they are architects of inspiration, builders of dreams, and sculptors of
the future. He appreciated how CTLPE had ignited his curiosity to explore
more strategies to enhance the motivation of design students.</p>

<p>Mr. Wee marveled at how rewarding he has found teaching to be after more
than a decade in hospitality and in the culinary world. One thing that
has struck him was that all students, regardless of age or generation,
need acknowledgment or recognition of their efforts; this has guided him
as he engages with students. Both wished their fellow graduands hearty
congratulations and encouraged their classmates to press on their journey
as educators.</p>
<p>The emphasis on learning was heightened through the inclusion of a panel
discussion featuring Associate Professor Mark Chong from Singapore Management
University and Ms. Iman Tang from Temasek Polytechnic, both recipients
of multiple teaching awards. This insightful conversation on the topic
of “How to better engage students in this post covid era” was moderated
by Mr. Mark Nivan from Singapore Polytechnic.</p>

<p>Associate Professor Mark Chong shared how it was important to him to constantly
try new things and challenge students, illustrating it with a recent instance
where he challenged his students to incorporate artificial intelligence
(AI) into their academic work. Despite the unfamiliarity of AI to both
the students and him, the endeavour proved to be a resounding success.
AP Mark’s teaching philosophy includes actively engaging students by initiating
conversations to understand their concerns and situations; this is important
especially for students who initially show a greater resistance to active
participation.</p>
<p>For Ms. Iman Tang, her satisfaction in teaching comes from helping students
to reach their academic goals; this resonates for her particularly with
adult learners who may have made sacrifices to attend lessons and complete
their courses. She also reminded the graduands that it was important to
continue learning new things themselves, and to remember what it is like
when encountering novel subjects or situations, so that we may empathise
with students who find themselves in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>The CTLPE graduates expressed appreciation for the panellists’ genuine
and candid discussion concerning the challenges encountered in teaching
and raised their own questions covering a wide range of topics such as
strategies for fostering punctuality among students and seeking advice
on effectively managing burnout as educators.</p>

<p>Dr Rajnish Gupta, Head of the Joint-Polytechnic Academy for Educators
(JP-AcE), continued the focus on learning in his closing remarks. He told
CTLPE graduates that the learning does not end with the end of CTLPE and
urged them to maintain active communication and provide mutual assistance
to their peers across various polytechnics, with the overarching objective
of fostering a unified spirit among the polytechnic community.&nbsp; Dr
Gupta also thanked the several groups of people involved in CTLPE across
the polytechnics, as it really does take a village to nurture new polytechnic
lecturers.</p>
