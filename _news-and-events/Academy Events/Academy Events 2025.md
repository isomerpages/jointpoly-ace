<p>Ms Yap Aye Wee, Head of Learning and Transformation, Group Human Resources
at OCBC Bank spoke on the topic of “From Learning to Impact: OCBC’s Blueprint
for Talent Development. She shared about OCBC Learning Philosophy, modified
from Deci and Ryan’s Self-Determination Theory, and how it underpinned
their Blueprint for Talent Development.</p>
<p>It focused on increasing opportunities for learning and working towards
a long-term mindset shift. This included building equity in being able
to access learning resources, and removing systemic barriers to support
the employees, managers, and organisation in developing their people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these together foster a culture of continuous learning and growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Plenary Talk #2: Shaping the Future of Learning in a Rapidly Changing World: Timely Changes, Timeless Constants</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Associate Professor Ng Pak Tee from the National Institute of Education,
NTU shared his thoughts on the role of educators in a rapidly changing
world, particularly with the disruptions caused by Gen AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He reminded the audience of a major disruption in the Singapore education
system in the past, when the bilingualism policy was put in place. Virtually
overnight, educators had to switch from Mandarin to English as the language
of instruction. It was a tough and painful transition, but it had to be
done. Similarly, today’s educators must become fluent in AI competencies
and developing students’ AI literacies for a rapidly evolving world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He left the audience with this thought:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Educators are people who plant trees, so that others may sit under the
trees… and no one knows who planted those trees in the first place.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Closing Address: Dr Rajnish Gupta, Head, JP-AcE</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p>Dr Gupta congratulated the graduates on their commitment, perseverance,
and purpose. He reflected that the programmes were transformative experiences
that enabled them to build capacity, spark innovation and strengthen collaboration.
In addition to new knowledge and skills, participants also built meaningful
connections across all five polytechnics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He charged the graduates to be the change-makers, the ones who would influence
the future of polytechnic education in Singapore and raise the bar across
the polytechnic sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Gupta also thanked all who worked together to make the programmes as
well as the final graduation ceremony a success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to all graduates! May you go on to plant many trees!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
