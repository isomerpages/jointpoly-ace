<p>Key insights from the panel discussion included:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Shaping Educational Cultures:</strong> Dr.
Manu Kapur stressed the need for educators to focus on shaping cultures
within their classrooms, schools, and communities to foster learning agility
and adaptability.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Embracing Productive Failure:</strong> All
panelists highlighted the role of failure in learning and innovation. Creating
safe spaces for students to fail and learn from their mistakes is crucial
for cultivating resilience and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Integrating Technology Wisely:</strong> The
panel underscored that while technology, including AI, offers significant
opportunities, it should support learning objectives rather than replace
fundamental teaching and learning processes.</p>
<p>During the panel discussion, graduates expressed appreciation for the
panelists' insights and asked thought-provoking questions about using AI
in the classroom and how to address the challenge of students preferring
to pursue university education over entering the industry directly after
graduation.</p>
<p>Dr. Kapur discussed "learn agility," the ability to quickly learn and
adapt to new situations and technologies, and "productive failure," where
failure is used as a tool for deeper learning and innovation. Dr. Ben Leong
emphasized managing and inspiring student motivation, warning against over-reliance
on technology, and advising students to develop skills beyond AI capabilities.
Dr. Pee shared examples of motivating students through their interests
and discussed the potential for AI to enhance learning when used alongside
human intelligence.</p>
