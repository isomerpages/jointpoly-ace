#### Workshop: Introduction to the Metaverse

Hi educators! Are you curious about the metaverse but not sure what it is?  
No worries! JP-AcE has dedicated months studying about it, so that you don't have to spend a long time doing so. In this 1-day beginner crash course tailored for polytechnic educators, we will help you to go from being a metaverse newbie to an explorer of the metaverse world.
 
As educators, staying informed about the latest advancements and emerging technologies is essential to remain relevant and future ready. Although the metaverse is still in its early stages of development and optimal conditions may not yet be fully present, this crash course offers an opportunity for educators to gain an early glimpse of its possibilities.
 
We will start by unpacking the essential terminologies and discussing the latest trends and issues related to the metaverse. You will then learn how to create your digital identity in the form of avatars, and we will take you on a metaverse world tour to examine user experience, platform affordances, and features. By the end of the workshop, you will have a better understanding of the metaverse and the tools to further your exploration of this rapidly evolving technology beyond this course.

28 polytechnic educators have attended Run 1 and Run 2 on 13 and 14 Jun 2023. Check out the fun shots below!
