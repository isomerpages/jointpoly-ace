<p>The Adult Education Series (AES) aims to support existing Adult Educators
to advance T&amp;L capabilities, expand skill sets necessary for adult
education, and empower reflective practices. Check out upcoming learning
opportunities below.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Workshop: From Intuition to Insight: Making Sense of Data to Empower Thriving Learning Environments</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Are our learners able to meet the learning outcomes? Who among them is
struggling?
<br>By addressing these questions promptly, we can:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Identify content that learners find difficult to grasp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognise and support students facing challenges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While classroom observations provide intuitive insights, we now have an
additional tool at our disposal. Guided by appropriate questions, we can
design classroom activities that generate data for visualisation and analysis.
We can then validate our observations with data and analyse student performance
over time, enabling timely and more precise interventions.</p>
<p>We will experience the above with a hands-on exercise using PowerBI where
we will create visualizations to help answer these questions. By the end
of this introductory course, we will gain a deeper appreciation of how
data can assist us in supporting our learners better.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>To participate in the hands-on exercise, you will need to have MS Excel
and PowerBI Desktop installed on your device. This exercise is optional,
and a demonstration will be provided.</p>
<p>PowerBI Desktop can be downloaded for free from the following url: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494&amp;msockid=07a9dfdc779f66132448c9c976da6763" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494&amp;msockid=07a9dfdc779f66132448c9c976da6763</a>
