<p>How can educators navigate the rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
while preparing for an uncertain future in the Training and Adult Education
(TAE) sector? Many are already adopting AI tools in their practice, but
questions remain about how to use them effectively, ethically, and with
adequate institutional support. At the same time, educators must anticipate
longer-term shifts that may reshape their roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>This session brings together these twin challenges. It begins with a sharing
on key findings from the International Survey led by IAL on Artificial
Intelligence in Higher Education, Training and Adult Learning, which captured
perspectives from nearly 2,000 educators across 37 countries. The results
highlight adoption trends, gaps in strategy, and the continuing demand
for professional development. The session will then move into a hands-on
futures thinking workshop that will guide participants to anticipate emerging
disruptions, imagine alternative futures, and reflect on the implications
for the TAE sector. Educators will have the opportunity to co-create perspectives
and solutions on how the sector can adapt and remain future-ready.</p>
<p>Jointly organized by IAL and JP-AcE, this CoP is open to adult educators
in Singapore and also to polytechnic educators.</p>
