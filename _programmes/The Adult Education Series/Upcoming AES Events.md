<p>The Focused Conversation Technique aims to elevate your facilitation excellence
through transformative conversation. You gain a working knowledge of the
principles, and process steps in the practice of Focused Conversation to
tap on the collective wisdom of the group using a 4-level process of awareness:-
observable, relational, interpretative, and decisional - which form a template
from which conversations can be drawn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Workshop Method aims to create a safe and respectful space for all
voices to be heard by employing a variety of visual and interactive tools.
Facilitators trained in The Workshop Method guide groups through a series
of structured processes. Facilitators trained in the Workshop Method gain
a working knowledge of the principles, and process steps in:- generating
new ideas, forming new relationships, discerning consensus, and confirming
the resolve.</p>
<p>This workshop is tailored for Adult Educators.</p>

<p>How often do you, as lecturers or adult educators, feel overwhelmed by
the demands of managing learners, meeting their diverse needs, and engaging
in constructive conversations that inspire and motivate them to become
effective learners? These challenges are common, yet many of us find it
difficult to break out of habitual thinking patterns or struggle to make
effective decisions in our professional roles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will explore the mindset and awareness necessary to thrive
in the workplace. We will examine how coaching can not only enhance your
personal and professional life but also improve how you communicate with
and support your learners.</p>
<p>By understanding key principles of workplace psychology, you will gain
valuable insights into addressing learner needs, refining communication,
and fostering an environment where both you and your students&nbsp;can&nbsp;excel.</p>
