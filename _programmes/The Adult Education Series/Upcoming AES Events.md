<p>The Focused Conversation Technique aims to elevate your facilitation excellence
through transformative conversation. You gain a working knowledge of the
principles, and process steps in the practice of Focused Conversation to
tap on the collective wisdom of the group using a 4-level process of awareness:-
observable, relational, interpretative, and decisional - which form a template
from which conversations can be drawn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Workshop Method aims to create a safe and respectful space for all
voices to be heard by employing a variety of visual and interactive tools.
Facilitators trained in The Workshop Method guide groups through a series
of structured processes. Facilitators trained in the Workshop Method gain
a working knowledge of the principles, and process steps in:- generating
new ideas, forming new relationships, discerning consensus, and confirming
the resolve.</p>
<p>This workshop is tailored for Adult Educators.</p>
