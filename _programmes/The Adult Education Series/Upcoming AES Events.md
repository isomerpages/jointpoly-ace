<p>Do you or your learners have a personal change goal that has proven resistant
to your sincerest intentions, best efforts and plans?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Learn how you can significantly enhance your capacity to deliver on your
goals through this enlightening workshop. The Immunity to Change (ITC)
approach is based on 30 years of research on adult development theory and
developed by Harvard University Professors Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey.

and overcome the hidden dynamics that prevent personal and professional
growth.</p>
