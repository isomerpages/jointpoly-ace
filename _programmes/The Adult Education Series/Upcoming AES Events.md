<p>This one-day immersive workshop equips CET educators with practical, research-informed
strategies to confidently manage disruptive behaviours in adult learning
classrooms. Grounded in andragogical principles, participants will explore
the root causes of disruptive behaviours and learn to apply targeted, proactive,
and de-escalation techniques. Through scenario-based discussions, collaborative
problem-solving, and realistic role-plays, educators will enhance their
ability to foster respectful, inclusive, and psychologically safe environments
that support meaningful learning for working professionals. Participants
will get to experience problem-based learning and discussions during the
workshop.</p>
