<h3><strong>Upcoming Professional Development Events</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1. Workshop: Engaging Learners through Classroom Learning Activities</strong></h4>

<p>Classroom learning activities designed for use in a lesson are intended
to engage learners, activate interest in content, promote retention and
make learning fun. By adding an element of fun and anticipation, these
activities could help learners stay motivated and improve retention of
learning.</p>
<p>However, the perceived obstacle could be that such activities are time-consuming
and tedious to conduct and implement. In this workshop, participants are
introduced to the play of a variety of activities ranging from ice-breakers,
energisers, trigger activities and experiential games. These activities
aim to address different learning needs, such as building rapport, uplift
energy levels and engagement, spark curiosity in new content and reinforce
key concepts through active learning. All activities introduced can be
conducted in 5 to 15 minutes and require no prop or minimum props, making
them easy to integrate into any lesson. Participants may look forward to
build a repertoire of quick, practical classroom games and activities to
engage learners and enhance learning, and modify learning activities to
cater to specific learning objectives and desired lesson outcomes.</p>
