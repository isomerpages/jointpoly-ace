<h4>Webinar: The Digital Future of Work and learning in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Adult Education Uploads/Feb 2024/GenAI.jpg">
</div>
<p>Generative AI has been a popular topic of discussion in recent years,
with the potential to transform the way we work and create. AI-generated
content, including images, videos, and text, has applications in marketing
campaigns, product design, and even scientific discovery. As generative
AI becomes more prevalent, its potential is too great to ignore, and it
will likely have an enormous impact on how we live and work.</p>
<p>In this session, we examine how professionals can use generative AI to
enhance their skills, expand their opportunities, and innovate. Using generative
AI also comes with challenges and ethical implications, such as ensuring
quality, avoiding plagiarism, and respecting intellectual property. The
digital future of work and learning must address these concerns and challenges
if it is to be inclusive, accessible, and equitable for everyone. Our goal
is to provide practical tips and examples on how to use generative AI tools
effectively and responsibly. To conclude, we envision how generative AI
can foster collaboration, diversity, and social impact as we move into
the age of generative AI. To achieve this, we must bring a human-centric
approach to generative AI that places people at the center of all our efforts.</p>

<p>Are you an adult educator looking to enhance your communication skills
for coaching performance? Join our new workshop designed specifically for
educators like you. This workshop focuses on clear, direct communication
skills and their effective application in coaching sessions.</p>

listening and gather important perspectives, including facts, emotions,
and values. You will learn how to reflect back your understanding of what
has been said, providing evidence that you have truly listened to your
coachees. We will also delve into the art of asking powerful questions
and giving feedback. The goal is to ask courageous questions that benefit
your staff, encourage growth, and provoke new insights. You will discover
how to create a safe space through good questioning and feedback techniques,
allowing for deeper insights into your coaching effectiveness. Effective
working relationships are built on strong rapport. You will also learn
observational skills such as mirroring and matching, leading, pacing, and
self-awareness. These skills will help you establish deep connections with
your coachees and create a productive coaching environment. Don’t miss
this opportunity to enhance your communication skills as a coach.</p>

<h4>Workshop: Coaching for Educators: Transforming Mindset to enhance Learner Engagement and Success</h4>
<p></p>
<p>How often do you, as lecturers or adult educators, feel overwhelmed by
the demands of managing learners, meeting their diverse needs, and engaging
in constructive conversations that inspire and motivate them to become
effective learners? These challenges are common, yet many of us find it
difficult to break out of habitual thinking patterns or struggle to make
effective decisions in our professional roles.</p>
<p>This session will explore the mindset and awareness necessary to thrive
in the workplace. We will examine how coaching can not only enhance your
personal and professional life but also improve how you communicate with
and support your learners.</p>
<p>By understanding key principles of workplace psychology, you will gain
valuable insights into addressing learner needs, refining communication,
and fostering an environment where both you and your students&nbsp;can&nbsp;excel.</p>
