<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Adult Education Uploads/Coaching_for_Educators.png">
</div>
<p>How often do you, as lecturers or adult educators, feel overwhelmed by
the demands of managing learners, meeting their diverse needs, and engaging
in constructive conversations that inspire and motivate them to become
effective learners? These challenges are common, yet many of us find it
difficult to break out of habitual thinking patterns or struggle to make
effective decisions in our professional roles.</p>
<p>This session will explore the mindset and awareness necessary to thrive
in the workplace. We will examine how coaching can not only enhance your
personal and professional life but also improve how you communicate with
and support your learners. By understanding key principles of workplace
psychology, you will gain valuable insights into addressing learner needs,
refining communication, and fostering an environment where both you and
your students can excel.</p>

<h3><u>July 2025</u></h3>
<h4>Workshop: From Intuition to Insight: Making Sense of Data to Empower Thriving Learning Environments</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Adult Education Uploads/Photo_1.jpg">

<p>Are our learners able to meet the learning outcomes? Who among them is
struggling?
<br>By addressing these questions promptly, we can:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Identify content that learners find difficult to grasp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognise and support students facing challenges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While classroom observations provide intuitive insights, we now have an
additional tool at our disposal. Guided by appropriate questions, we can
design classroom activities that generate data for visualisation and analysis.
We can then validate our observations with data and analyse student performance
over time, enabling timely and more precise interventions.</p>
<p>We will experience the above with a hands-on exercise using PowerBI where
we will create visualizations to help answer these questions. By the end
of this introductory course, we will gain a deeper appreciation of how
data can assist us in supporting our learners better.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>To participate in the hands-on exercise, you will need to have MS Excel
and PowerBI Desktop installed on your device. This exercise is optional,
and a demonstration will be provided.</p>
<p>PowerBI Desktop can be downloaded for free from the following url: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494&amp;msockid=07a9dfdc779f66132448c9c976da6763" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494&amp;msockid=07a9dfdc779f66132448c9c976da6763</a>

<h4>Workshop: Engaging Learners through Classroom Learning Activities</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>Classroom learning activities designed for use in a lesson are intended
to engage learners, activate interest in content, promote retention and
make learning fun. By adding an element of fun and anticipation, these
activities could help learners stay motivated and improve retention of
learning.</p>
<p>However, the perceived obstacle could be that such activities are time-consuming
and tedious to conduct and implement. In this workshop, participants are
introduced to the play of a variety of activities ranging from ice-breakers,
energisers, trigger activities and experiential games. These activities
aim to address different learning needs, such as building rapport, uplift
energy levels and engagement, spark curiosity in new content and reinforce
key concepts through active learning. All activities introduced can be
conducted in 5 to 15 minutes and require no prop or minimum props, making
them easy to integrate into any lesson. Participants may look forward to
build a repertoire of quick, practical classroom games and activities to
engage learners and enhance learning, and modify learning activities to
cater to specific learning objectives and desired lesson outcomes.</p>
