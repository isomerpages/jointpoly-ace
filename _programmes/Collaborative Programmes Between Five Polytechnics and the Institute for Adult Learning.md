#### Workshop: Communication Skils for Coaching Performance (Run 1)

Are you an adult educator looking to enhance your communication skills for coaching performance? Join our new workshop designed specifically for educators like you. This workshop focuses on clear, direct communication skills and their effective application in coaching sessions.

The workshop will help you develop the essential communication skills needed to excel as a coach. As a coach, it is important to go beyond active listening and gather important perspectives, including facts, emotions, and values. You will learn how to reflect back your understanding of what has been said, providing evidence that you have truly listened to your coachees.

We will also delve into the art of asking powerful questions and giving feedback. The goal is to ask courageous questions that benefit your staff, encourage growth, and provoke new insights. You will discover how to create a safe space through good questioning and feedback techniques, allowing for deeper insights into your coaching effectiveness.

Effective working relationships are built on strong rapport. You will also learn observational skills such as mirroring and matching, leading, pacing, and self-awareness. These skills will help you establish deep connections with your coachees and create a productive coaching environment.

Don't miss this opportunity to enhance your communication skills as a coach. Sign up today!
