Adult educators can look forward to learning from the following initiatives:

* Community of Practice (COP)
* Programmatic or Project-based Partnership
* Attachments/ Secondments / Staff Exchange
* Other collaborative opportunities which may evolve or emerge from time to time, subject to the discussion and agreement of both Parties.

More details of these initiatives will be made available at later date. Do visit this website again for updates.
