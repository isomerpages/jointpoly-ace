Looking to establish a deeper connection with your adult learners and hope to enhance their engagement in your classes?Â 

Join us for the upcoming Adult Education Community of Practice (COP) Run 2, a collaboration between the Joint Polytechnic Academy for Educators and the Institute for Adult Learning, which will offer you a deeper understanding of affective engagement and practical strategies to support adult learners better.

During this session, you will be guided to examine what it means to be engaged affectively and how educators can reflect on their learning experiences to identify key indicators for affective engagement. You will gain insight into the importance of affective engagement in adult learning, its impact on learners' motivation, and the role of educators in supporting it. You will also have the opportunity to learn from each other by crowdsourcing ideas and identifying effective strategies and tips for engaging adult learners affectively.
