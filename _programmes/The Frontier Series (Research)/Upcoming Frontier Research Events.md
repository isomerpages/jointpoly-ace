<p>The Frontier Series for Educators is a repertoire of professional development
sessions organised by the Joint Polytechnic Academy for Educators (JP-AcE)
for polytechnic educators. The Frontier Series aims to inspire lifelong
learning, support reflective T&amp;L practices, expand T&amp;L capabilities
and empower educators to be future-ready by exploring new educational trends
and innovative ways of teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The Frontier Series has two key learning tracks currently. They are:</p>

<h3>Upcoming Education Research Learning Events</h3>
<h4>1. Workshop: Action Research: Empowering Educators to Enhance their Pedagogical Practices (Run 1)</h4>
<p></p>
<p>This workshop is designed to enhance the competencies of polytechnic educators
by equipping them with essential skills to identify and address teaching
and learning (T&amp;L) problems through action research.</p>
<p>Participants will be introduced to the 4-stage action research cycle,
learn how to unpack T&amp;L problems, and propose appropriate interventions
to resolve these. Through a case study, participants will be guided in
conducting a literature review, formulating research questions, designing
a mixed-methods study, selecting appropriate methods for collecting &amp;
analysing data, and translating research findings into reflective practice.
Finally, participants will be introduced to relevant AI tools and to address
the ethical considerations when conducting action research.</p>
