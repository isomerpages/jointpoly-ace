<p>This workshop is designed to enhance the competencies of polytechnic educators
by equipping them with essential skills to identify and address teaching
and learning (T&amp;L) problems through action research.</p>
<p>Participants will be introduced to the 4-stage action research cycle,
learn how to unpack T&amp;L problems, and propose appropriate interventions
to resolve these. Through a case study, participants will be guided in
conducting a literature review, formulating research questions, designing
a mixed-methods study, selecting appropriate methods for collecting &amp;
analysing data, and translating research findings into reflective practice.
Finally, participants will be introduced to relevant AI tools and to address
the ethical considerations when conducting action research</p>
