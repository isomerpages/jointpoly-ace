<p>In this webinar, we will explore how people learn through social knowledge
platforms like Reddit and Discord. We will examine features such as ease
of use, privacy, and a less formal atmosphere. We will discuss techniques
for verifying information and evaluating the credibility of a community.
If you run or participate in such communities, we would love to hear about
your experience.</p>
