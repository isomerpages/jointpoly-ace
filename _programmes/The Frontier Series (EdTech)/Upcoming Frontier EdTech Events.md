<h3><strong>Upcoming Professional Development Events</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1. Workshop: Minecraft for Teaching: From Play to Pedagogy</strong></h4>
<p></p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://pinecone.academy/blog/exploring-mods-for-minecraft-education-edition-enhancing-learning-through-creativity"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Frontier Series/Minecraft1.jpg"></a>
<p>Are you wondering how you can design a virtual world for more immersive,
interactive, online learning experiences? Did you know that you have access
to Minecraft Education through your poly’s Microsoft O365 subscription?
(Note: SP does not have an institutional subscription, but colleagues can
access trial accounts.)</p>
<p>You may have heard about or played Minecraft. Now, experience Minecraft
from a teacher’s lens in this hands‑on workshop. We’ll explore how to design
interactive learning using sandbox worlds that drive creativity, collaboration,
and problem‑solving.</p>
<p>You’ll try classroom‑tested activities and adapt ready‑made templates
to your subject. Leave with a mini‑lesson plan, assessment ideas, and practical
rollout tips for your own classes. No prior Minecraft or coding experience
required!</p>
