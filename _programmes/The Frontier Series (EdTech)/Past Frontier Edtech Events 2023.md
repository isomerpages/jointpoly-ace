<p>Hi educators! Are you curious about the metaverse but not sure what it
is?
<br>No worries! JP-AcE has dedicated months studying about it, so that you
don't have to spend a long time doing so. In this 1-day beginner crash
course tailored for polytechnic educators, we will help you to go from
being a metaverse newbie to an explorer of the metaverse world.</p>
<p>As educators, staying informed about the latest advancements and emerging
technologies is essential to remain relevant and future ready. Although
the metaverse is still in its early stages of development and optimal conditions
may not yet be fully present, this crash course offers an opportunity for
educators to gain an early glimpse of its possibilities.</p>
<p>We will start by unpacking the essential terminologies and discussing
the latest trends and issues related to the metaverse. You will then learn
how to create your digital identity in the form of avatars, and we will
take you on a metaverse world tour to examine user experience, platform
affordances, and features. By the end of the workshop, you will have a
better understanding of the metaverse and the tools to further your exploration
of this rapidly evolving technology beyond this course.</p>
<p>28 polytechnic educators have attended Run 1 and Run 2 on 13 and 14 Jun
2023. Check out the fun shots below!</p>
