SLMP is a 200-hour programme that takes place over a period of 12 months. The inaugural intake took place from November 2021 to November 2022. The second run of SLMP commenced in May 2023 with SLMP 2023 Onboarding Programme and will conclude in May 2024. The timing of subsequent runs of SLMP will be dependent on the needs of the polytechnic sector.

#### Check out what happened at the Joint Polytechnic School Leadership Move-In Programme (SLMP) Intake 2

SLMP Intake 2 started in May 2023 with a five-day onboarding programme. 
15 school leaders from the five polytechnics delved into concepts of educational change, teaching and learning (T&amp;L) quality and T&amp;L culture. They were in turn inspired, challenged, intrigued, and encouraged by what they experienced; the Learning Journeys to Pathlight School and AI Singapore provided much food for thought. An important takeaway for all was that people are at the heart of leadership.

SLMP 2023 continued with a series of learning journeys to the various polytechnics. These visits allowed participants to see best practices of applied learning and integration of industry into T&amp;L facilities and curriculum.

Throughout SLMP, participants worked on their SLMP practicum projects relating to theme such as industry engagement, pedagogical innovation, as well as lifelong learning. They also took part in a visioning exercise to analyse future trends that could affect the polytechnic sector (the SLMP Group Pitch). As part of SLMP, dialogues with senior polytechnic leaders provided inputs on their Group Pitch.

The programme culminated in a Leadership Forum in May 2024, which was a celebration of the SLMP journey for participants, and an opportunity for their Project Sponsors to hear their Group Pitch and to hear about their practicum projects as well as their reflections on T&amp;L leadership.
