#### When is the programme conducted?

SLMP is a 160-hour programme that takes place over a period of 7-8 months. The inaugural Intake 1 started in Nov 2021.  This programme typically runs once a year and the timing of the runs is dependent on the needs of the polytechnic sector.


#### What typically happens at the Joint Polytechnic School Leadership Move-In Programme?

SLMP typically starts with a five-day onboarding programme where emerging school leaders from the five polytechnics will delved into concepts of educational change, teaching and learning (T&amp;L) quality and T&amp;L culture. 
The onboarding sessions are designed to inspire, challenge, intrigue, and encourage them through the varied experiences such as 

1.	Fireside Chats with PCEOs;
2. Workshops on Educational Change, Quality &amp; Culture;
3. Panel Discussions with external and internal guests; and
4. Learning Journeys

After the 5 days onboarding programme, SLMP will continue with a series of Check in Meets held at the various polytechnics. During these Check in Meets, participants will visit various Polytechnics and get to see best practices of applied learning and integration of industry into T&amp;L facilities and curriculum. They might get to have more Fireside chats with Polytechnic School Leaders such as PCEOs or DPs.

Throughout SLMP, participants will work on their SLMP practicum projects relating to themes such as industry engagement, pedagogical innovation, lifelong learning as well as digitalisation. They will take part in a visioning exercise to analyse future trends that could affect the polytechnic sector (i.e. the SLMP Group Pitch).

The programme will culminate in a Leadership Forum, which is a celebration of the SLMP journey for participants, and an opportunity for their Project Sponsors to hear their Group Pitches and to hear about their practicum projects as well as their reflections on T&amp;L leadership.

The Forum is also intended for networking and provides an opportunity for participants to consolidate their learning from the year-long programme. It also allows for deeper &nbsp;conversations between participants, Project Sponsors and Directors of Educational Development Units before the participants graduate from the programme.
