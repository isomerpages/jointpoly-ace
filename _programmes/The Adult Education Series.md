#### Workshop: Communication Skills for Coaching Performance (Run 1)

Adult educators from the polytechnics and the Institute of Adult Learning (IAL) came together on 25 August 2023 at Singapore Polytechnic to learn to enhance their coaching through sharpening their communication skills.Â 

The group explored the difference between coaching and mentoring, and discussed the challenges in asking good questions for coaching. A range of skills (such as mirroring and matching, leading and pacing) supporting the tasks of a coach were also touched on. Participants enjoyed role play activities to practise and reflect on their application of their skills.

Staff who attended appreciated the opportunity to interact with other adult educators, and to share insights and refresh their own journey as coaches and trainers.
