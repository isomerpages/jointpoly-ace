The Adult Education Series (AES) aims to support existing Adult Educators from polytechnics and IAL to advance T&L capabilities, expand skill sets necessary for adult education, and empower reflective practices. Check out upcoming learning opportunities below.


#### 1. Workshop: Communication Skills for Coaching Performance (Run 1)

Are you an adult educator looking to enhance your communication skills for coaching performance? Join our new workshop designed specifically for educators like you. This workshop focuses on clear, direct communication skills and their effective application in coaching sessions.

The workshop will help you develop the essential communication skills needed to excel as a coach. As a coach, it is important to go beyond active listening and gather important perspectives, including facts, emotions, and values. You will learn how to reflect back your understanding of what has been said, providing evidence that you have truly listened to your coachees.

We will also delve into the art of asking powerful questions and giving feedback. The goal is to ask courageous questions that benefit your staff, encourage growth, and provoke new insights. You will discover how to create a safe space through good questioning and feedback techniques, allowing for deeper insights into your coaching effectiveness.

Effective working relationships are built on strong rapport. You will also learn observational skills such as mirroring and matching, leading, pacing, and self-awareness. These skills will help you establish deep connections with your coachees and create a productive coaching environment.

Don't miss this opportunity to enhance your communication skills as a coach. Sign up today!

The Joint Polytechnic Academy for Educators (JP-AcE) and the Institute for Adult Learning (IAL) have come together to organise another run of Adult Education Community of Practice for adult educators across five polytechnics and IAL on 19 July 2023 at Temasek Polytechnic. 
  
Passionate educators from various institutions spent the afternoon sharing strategies and tips for affective engagement. The energy and enthusiasm in the room were palpable, and it was incredible to witness the collective expertise of our educators coming together. This initiative presents a remarkable opportunity for adult educators to connect, collaborate, and learn from each other.
