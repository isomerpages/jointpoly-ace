**1.Community of Practice (COP)**

a)The target audience are the teaching staff, Adult Educators (AEs) and Adjunct AEs from Polytechnics and SUSS-IAL.

b)Collegial sharing or exchange of best or state-of-the-art practices on common topics of interest of the targeted audience for mutual benefits.

c)COP topics, including learning journeys, can be jointly discussed based on needs and resources available, and included in a yearly work-plan.

**2.Programmatic or Project-based Partnership**

a)Polytechnics and SUSS-IAL shall provide possible areas of joint collaboration for programmatic / project-based partnership.

b)Co-curation/co-development and co-delivery of programmes, and levelling up of specific competencies for Polytechnics’ AEs, in areas including but not limited to the existing and the new programmes offered by the Joint Polytechnic Virtual Academy (VA).

c)Co-curation/co-development and co-delivery of a full module(s) or part of a full WSQ programme or Programme(s) designed and aligned to the SSG’s Skills Framework for the TAE Sector and/or corporate trainers in enterprises with contextualised needs.

d)Co-curation of Continuing Professional Development programmes (e.g. bite size, micro-learning credentialling, e-learning modules) to uplift AEs’ skillsets in both Polytechnics and SUSS-IAL.  

**3.Attachments/ Secondments / Staff Exchange**

a)Short term mutual cross attachments of staff between SUSS-IAL and Polytechnic for a period of two (2) months or longer but not more than six (6) months, where the duration and scope of the attachment and assignments to be performed are mutually agreed. For ease of implementation, each Party will continue to be responsible for the salary, Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution and benefits of its own staff attached to another Party. 

b)Secondment of SUSS-IAL staff to the Joint-Polytechnic VA or Polytechnic staff to SUSS-IAL for a period of six (6) months or longer. For ease of implementation, each Party will continue to be responsible for the salary, CPF contribution and benefits of its own staff attached to another Party.

c)Polytechnic staff undertaking Continuing Education and Training (CET) teaching at SUSS-IAL as part of the programmatic or project-based partnership arrangement will be paid accordingly based on the prevailing Adjunct AE’s rate in SUSS-IAL, with headcount resourced through the current CET mechanism.

**4.Other collaborative opportunities which may evolve or emerge from time to time, subject to the discussion and agreement of both Parties.**
