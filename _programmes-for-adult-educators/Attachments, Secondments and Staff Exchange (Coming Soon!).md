**Attachments/ Secondments / Staff Exchange**

![](/images/94213049_ML.jpg)

The JP-AcE organises the following learning opportunities:

* Short term mutual cross attachments of staff between SUSS-IAL and Polytechnic for a period of two (2) months or longer but not more than six (6) months, where the duration and scope of the attachment and assignments to be performed are mutually agreed.
* Secondment of SUSS-IAL staff to the Joint-Polytechnic VA or Polytechnic staff to SUSS-IAL for a period of six (6) months or longer.
* Polytechnic staff can undertake Continuing Education and Training (CET) teaching at SUSS-IAL as part of the programmatic or project-based partnership arrangement and will be paid accordingly based on the prevailing Adjunct AEâ€™s rate in SUSS-IAL, with headcount resourced through the current CET mechanism.
